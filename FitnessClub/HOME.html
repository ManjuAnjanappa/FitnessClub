<center> <h1>ABOUT FITNESS</h1></center>
<br>
<h6>Fitness is defined as the quality or state of being fit and healthy.
Around 1950, perhaps consistent with the Industrial Revolution and the treatise of
 World War II, the term "fitness" increased in western vernacular by a factor of 
ten.The modern definition of fitness describes either a person or machine's 
ability to perform a specific function or a holistic definition of human 
adaptability to cope with various situations. This has led to an interrelation of 
human fitness and attractiveness that has mobilized global fitness and fitness 
equipment industries. Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to 
persons who possess significant aerobic or anaerobic ability, i.e. endurance or 
strength. A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all aspects of 
fitness compared to practicing only one, such as only cardio/respiratory endurance 
or only weight training.</h6>

<h6>A comprehensive fitness program tailored to an individual typically focuses 
on one or more specific skills,and on age or health-related needs such as 
bone health.Many sources also cite mental, social and emotional health as 
an important part of overall fitness. This is often presented in textbooks as a 
triangle made up of three points, which represent physical, emotional, and mental 
fitness. Physical fitness can also prevent or treat many chronic health conditions 
brought on by unhealthy lifestyle or aging.Working out can also help some people 
sleep better and possibly alleviate some mood disorders in certain individuals.</h6>
